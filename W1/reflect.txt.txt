My reflection:


This was my first workshop in OOP244 and to be fair honest, it was long time since I have coding in c or cpp language. Moreover, it was quite a bit struggle since I shifted my focus from web development to object oriented programming language like cpp. 

I started my project by properly cutting it in small modules. We got the w1p1.cpp file in which all code was written in one file which made difficult to understand and maintain it. 

I got confused by looking at it, so decided, to breakdown it in modules.
We also did milestones in SFT211, where professor gave us to build truck delivery system, we had quite big system to look over so that time as well I used modules which came handy for us. We had 6 milestones in so,
we created vivid modules and assign it to different memebers of group which help the project to run smoothly. As there multiple module not one, so nobody's work for stopped or conflicted which boosted the productivity
and help us to learn the best approach which was moduling and categorizing.

All in all, I learnt how to organized, maintain and categorized the code in better manner which helps to avoid errors and track down them if found.
